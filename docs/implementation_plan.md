## Phase Dependencies

Each phase builds upon the previous ones:

- **Phase 1** → **Phase 2**: Database foundation required for user authentication
- **Phase 2** → **Phase 3**: User authentication needed for game management
- **Phase 3** → **Phase 4**: Core entities required for characters and plots
- **Phase 4** → **Phase 5**: Full functionality needed for comprehensive testing

## Weekly Milestones

Each week will end with:
- Working, testable functionality
- Updated documentation
- Code review and refactoring
- Integration with existing components
- Preparation for next phase

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints throughout
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Implement proper error handling
- Maintain high test coverage

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches for each major component
- Regular commits with descriptive messages
- Code review before merging
- Tag releases at end of each phase

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Performance testing for database queries

### Documentation
- Keep API documentation updated
- Document complex business logic
- Maintain deployment instructions
- Update README with setup instructions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **Scalability Issues**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined deliverables for each phase
- **Technical Debt**: Allocate time for refactoring in each phase
- **Dependencies**: Identify and address blocking issues early

### Quality Risks
- **Insufficient Testing**: Maintain minimum test coverage requirements
- **Poor Documentation**: Document as you build, not after
- **Code Quality**: Regular code reviews and static analysis

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage >90%
- API response times <200ms
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- 100% endpoint documentation

### Functional Metrics
- All CRUD operations working
- Authentication system fully functional
- Complex relationships properly implemented
- Combined endpoints returning correct data

### Quality Metrics
